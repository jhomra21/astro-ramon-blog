## BitDefense: Strategic Tower Defense Reimagined

BitDefense is a super minimal classic tower defense game running in your browser!
### Source Code

Check out the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/jhomra21/tower-def-game) to see how BitDefense was built.

### Key Features

- **Immersive 3D Graphics**: Leveraging Three.js for stunning visual effects and smooth animations
- **Strategic Depth**: 
  - 3 distinct tower types (Light, Normal, Heavy) with unique attributes
  - 3 enemy variants with different health pools and movement speeds
  - Resource management system for tower placement and upgrades
- **Progressive Challenge**:
  - 3 unique levels with different path layouts
  - 10 rounds per level with increasing difficulty
  - Dynamic difficulty scaling to maintain engagement

### Gameplay Mechanics

- **Health System**: 
  - Start with 100 base health
  - Gain 10 health each round
  - Lose 5 health per enemy breach
- **Tower Types**:
  - Light: Fast-firing, low damage
  - Normal: Balanced damage and rate of fire
  - Heavy: High damage, slow rate of fire
- **Enemy Variants**:
  - Light: Fast but fragile
  - Normal: Balanced stats
  - Heavy: Slow but durable

### Technical Implementation

Built with modern web technologies focusing on performance:
- **TypeScript** for type-safe game logic
- **Three.js** for efficient 3D rendering
- **Vite** for optimal development experience and build performance
- **WebGL** for hardware-accelerated graphics
