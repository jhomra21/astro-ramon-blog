I built a simple yet powerful web application that allows users to convert video files into GIF format directly in their browser. 
I needed to convert a ton of videos to GIFs for a clients site, and none of the tools I found were good IMO, so i made this using ffmpeg on the browser,
you dont need to upload anything, all you need is your file. I get ffmpeg and its utils from my own Cloud Flare bucket so i dont have to 
worry or rely on external cdn not having the ffmpeg version i need.

## Features

- Browser-based video to GIF conversion
- No file size limits
- Fast processing
- Clean, minimal interface
- Open source
- FFmpeg on the browser
- No ads, no tracking, no login, no signup, simple as it gets
