I created 'What Color Is This', a web application that identifies colors from images, because I needed to extract exact
color codes from images in order to build a matching UI and site for a client. Simply upload an image, and the app will 
provide you with the exact color code where you click on the image.

## Features

- Accurate color identification
- Supports multiple image formats
- User-friendly interface
- Fast and reliable
- Save color codes
- Easily copy color codes to clipboard
